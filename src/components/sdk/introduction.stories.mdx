# SDK Components

SDK Components provide you the capability to build out a realtime meeting experience easily. They have a dependency on providers being rendered in your application tree, which subsequently have a dependency on the `amazon-chime-sdk-js`.

SDK components are aimed at accelerating your Amazon Chime SDK application development.

For the majority of use cases, a chime application consists of **a server application** and **a client application**.

* A server application – Manages meeting and attendee resources, and serves those resources to the client application. The server application is created in the AWS account and must have access to the IAM role mentioned previously.
* A client application – Receives meeting and attendee information from the server application, and uses that information to make media.

See the [client application example](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk/tree/main/apps/meeting/src) and [server application example](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk/blob/main/apps/meeting/server.js).

## Getting Started

1. Add amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react and the necessary peer dependencies to your project

```sh
npm install --save amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react amazon-chime-sdk-js styled-components styled-system
```

2. Render a `ThemeProvider` and a `MeetingProvider` in the root of your application
   * You can pass a default theme that we provide, or a customized theme that adheres to our theme's structure.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import {
  lightTheme,
  MeetingProvider
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    <MeetingProvider>
      <MyApp />
    </MeetingProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

3. Use the SDK components to build your app

_Note_ - Some components won't render anything unless there is an active meeting. To join a meeting, you need to use the `join` and `start` APIs that are provided through the [useMeetingManager](/docs/sdk-hooks-usemeetingmanager--page) hook.

```jsx
import {
  VideoTileGrid,
  useMeetingManager
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  const joinMeeting = async () => {
    // Fetch the meeting and attendee data from your server application
    const response = await fetch('/my-server');
    const data = await response.json();

    const joinData = {
      meetingInfo: data.Meeting,
      attendeeInfo: data.Attendee
    };

    // Use the join API to create a meeting session using the above data
    await meetingManager.join(joinData);

    // At this point you can let users setup their devices
    ...

    // Start the session immediately to join the meeting
    await meetingManager.start();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={joinMeeting}>Join</button>
      <VideoTileGrid />
    </>
  );
};
```
